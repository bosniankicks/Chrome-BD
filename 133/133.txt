--- üß™ Browser vs. Playwright Differences ---
VM68:145 ‚ö†Ô∏è energySaverFreezing:
VM68:146    Browser: 50.00000 ms
VM68:147    Playwright: 50.00500 ms

From my testing, the energy saver mode always stays static with 50.00500 in playwright

VM68:145 ‚ö†Ô∏è wasmMemory64:
VM68:146    Browser: {"bufferType":"object","pages":6,"growthTime":"0.00000 ms"}
VM68:147    Playwright: {"bufferType":"object","pages":6,"growthTime":"0.01000 ms"}

With wasmMemory64, I always get a bit of a delay within growth time in the playwright browser

VM68:145 ‚ö†Ô∏è multipleImportMaps:
VM68:146    Browser: false
VM68:147    Playwright: true

Always get this true with playwright
