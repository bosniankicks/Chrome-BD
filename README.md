# Chrome-BD (Chrome Bot Detection)
chrome bot detection based off each release version. Each version has new updates or old ways to detect browser bots


I wanted to add this as I work as an offensive browser engineer, and wanted to see companies perchance try to use different data across the web for new ways to detect bots

If you want to add things you find, create a folder for a PR for merges for each release , i use https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/133 to see what can be targeted ! :)
